### [Intent of the District Inquiry Project:](http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/ltm/Pages/default.aspx)
An opportunity for school teams to work together at the school level to explore a variety of methods for documenting knowledge, skills and attitudes (and helping our students to document their learning), and then to come together at the District level to discuss the myriad of opportunities and possibilities around Communicating Student Learning.



### [BC Min Ed - Rationale](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/administration/legislation-policy/public-schools/student-reporting)

The Ministry of Education is redesigning curriculum and assessment to fit with the modern education system needed for today’s world. Redesigned curriculum for Grades K-9 is being implemented in the 2016/2017 school year.  In addition, parental engagement about student progress reporting is taking place during the 2016/17 school year.

To provide flexibility beginning in the 2016/2017 school year, Boards of Education that have developed or are developing new student progress reporting policies and procedures for students in Grades K-9 may use these practices if they meet the Interim Student Reporting Guidelines contained in this policy.
