> As I was describing my interactive math app, Drawing Area, in Information-Processing, Microworlds, and Drawing Area, I was struck by how often my goal is to arm students with the feedback they need to solve problems by hill climbing. 

> When I was teaching middle school, seventh-graders were expected to learn two algorithms: one for finding the greatest common factor (GCF) and one for finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using prime factorization. Although the two algorithms are similar, you would never mix them up if you understood what you were doing.

```72 = 2³ × 3²
96 = 2⁵ × 3¹
Compare the exponents on the 2 and the exponents on the 3.
To find the GCF of 72 and 96, choose the smaller exponents:
2³ × 3¹ = 24.
To find the LCM of 72 and 96, choose the greater exponents:
2⁵ × 3² = 288.```
