# Structure

## Genre - article review

## Beginning
* This is what I got from this article or experience:
vertical learning unit dev scaffold

* This is what I will use it for going forward:
unit overview for STEM disease unit

### Thesis - imp

## Middle

### Unit start
* little background on _ resume (personal) vs. ad (less personal) vs. ? _ writing
* short enough that we can revise them rapidly over many drafts
* writing explicitly to communicate a message to an audience
* create a first draft of their own _blank_ 
* entries are written on individual index cards so that entries can be swapped in and out, and moved around.
* may not feel work is good.  Students have done a lot more in life than they realize; they just need to build a stronger narrative to bring those stories to the forefront.
* select a few students who list same _blank_ under _blank_ and conduct a model interview. By asking probing questions, I uncover details about their _blank_ experiences, which I write on the whiteboard.

### Building an engine (grounding mental models)
#### Can I rewrite this action to make the _blank_ that I’m highlighting stand out more?
* Once the students see how details can punch up a _blank_ and add color, more details pour out until the whiteboard is covered in them. We marvel at some of the anecdotes and students view each other with new appreciation. 
* Reading these details, what impressions do we form about the _blank_? 
* Is this _blank_ _blank_? _blank_? A _blank_?
* We generate a list of _blank_ characteristics from the list of details, and I pick one characteristic to build a _blank_ entry around. * Which details would we include if we wanted to show how _blank_ we are? How would we rewrite those details to emphasize our _blank_? 
* What if we wanted to highlight our _blank_ instead? 
* After creating a sample entry as a class, we break into small groups to write other entries, using the characteristics and details on the whiteboard as our mystery box ingredients. 
* When each group shares their _blank_ entry at the end of class, we try to guess the characteristics being highlighted.

The next day, we summarize our takeaways from the _blank_ entry activity:

* We use a _blank_ to tell our story.
* The details we choose to share create an impression.
* In a _blank_, we describe ourselves through actions, not adjectives.
* Because a _blank_ is so dense and economical, every word counts.
* We should read our _blank_ through the eyes of a potential employer.
* A _blank_ should be focused to create impact.
* We have done a lot more than we realize.
* You can tell a lot about a person from their actions.

The students then pair off to interview each other and brainstorm. Their goal is to generate lists of characteristics and details based on their own personal experiences before narrowing their stories down to a focused résumé. Once they think they know the characteristics they’d like to highlight, they start writing entries on index cards and workshopping those entries with other students. 

### Rebuilding the engine with new gears (scaling mental models)
#### Are there other experiences and actions in my history that better reflect this characteristic?
#### When analyzing my experiences and actions, are there other characteristics that could be highlighted that I have overlooked?

This engine starts with three nested feedback loops, which the students internalize by repeatedly asking themselves three key questions:
 
* Can I rewrite this action to make the characteristic that I’m highlighting stand out more?
* Are there other experiences and actions in my history that better reflect this characteristic?
* When analyzing my experiences and actions, are there other characteristics that could be highlighted that I have overlooked?

We ask ourselves the first question constantly while writing. We ask the other two questions in the planning phase before writing — but also when we get stuck or step back to evaluate and reflect on our work. The questions represent different gears in our engine. Shifting between those gears prompts us to change our perspective and engage in both convergent and divergent thinking as necessary.


### Using the engine to take us places (leveraging mental models)
#### What do my actions tell me about me?
We explicitly leverage our résumé writing skills and analytical engine to develop strong characters in fiction and to study people in general for the rest of the year. Along the way, we rebuild our engine by adding a fourth gear or feedback loop: What does a person’s actions tell us about that person?
Shifting their engines through the first three gears and not finding the answers they were expecting slammed students into the fourth gear, triggering cognitive dissonance: What do my actions tell me about me?


### Driving into the unknown (seeking out cognitive dissonance)
#### Is the truth of me always reflected in my actions? Can we change the truth of ourselves by changing our actions?
We use these questions to rebuild our engines, adding a fifth gear; and we use that engine to set new personal goals by writing the résumé we would like to write in two years — at the end of our freshman year in high school — if we were the person we wanted to be.
