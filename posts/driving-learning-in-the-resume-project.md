## Beginning

Came arcross [David Ng's](https://medium.com/@dng_16133) [Driving Learning in The Résumé Project](https://medium.com/vertical-learning/driving-learning-in-the-r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9-project-b38b9005ad56).  Very taken with the his [Vertical Learning](https://medium.com/vertical-learning/why-we-should-learn-vertically-ae898e1ceb29#.a2pig8lno)

* This is what I got from this article or experience:
real to fiction & vertical learning unit dev scaffold

* This is what I will use it for going forward:
unit overview for STEM disease unit

### Thesis - imp

## Middle - 1 - what did

Here is the engine we built in The Résumé Project:
* Can I rewrite this action to make the characteristic that I’m highlighting stand out more?
* Are there other experiences and actions in my history that better reflect this characteristic?
* When analyzing my experiences and actions, are there other characteristics that could be highlighted that I have overlooked?
* What do my actions tell me about me?
* Is the truth of me always reflected in my actions? Can we change the truth of ourselves by changing our actions?

The use of engine and gears being a nod to Seymour Papert, [The Gears of My Childhood](http://www.papert.org/articles/GearsOfMyChildhood.html)

## Middle - 2 - connect real to fiction/other for Students Autism Spectrum

connection between resume writing and Character Studies in fiction
Taking advantage of our brand new résumé writing skills, we create character studies for characters we create ourselves and characters we find in works of fiction.
We explicitly leverage our résumé writing skills and analytical engine to develop strong characters in fiction and to study people in general for the rest of the year. 

## Middle - 3 - springboard

This was an opportunity to be thoughtful and intentional,
a more powerful experience.
The discussion was real and personal, not abstract
By starting from a shared understanding, we were able to revise and extend that shared understanding together.
And in writing future résumés, we didn’t start from a place of wish-fulfillment. We asked hard questions: 

The key is:
* Building an engine (grounding mental models)
* Rebuilding the engine with new gears (scaling mental models)
* Using the engine to take us places (leveraging mental models)
* Driving into the unknown (seeking out cognitive dissonance)
