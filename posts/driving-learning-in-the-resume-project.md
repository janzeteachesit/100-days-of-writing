When each group shares their babysitting entry at the end of class, we try to guess the characteristics being highlighted.
The next day, we summarize our takeaways from the babysitting entry activity:

* We use a résumé to tell our story.
* The details we choose to share create an impression.
* In a résumé, we describe ourselves through actions, not adjectives.
* Because a résumé is so dense and economical, every word counts.
* We should read our résumés through the eyes of a potential employer.
* A résumé should be focused to create impact.
* We have done a lot more than we realize.
* You can tell a lot about a person from their actions.

The students then pair off to interview each other and brainstorm. Their goal is to generate lists of characteristics and details based on their own personal experiences before narrowing their stories down to a focused résumé. Once they think they know the characteristics they’d like to highlight, they start writing entries on index cards and workshopping those entries with other students. 

This engine starts with three nested feedback loops, which the students internalize by repeatedly asking themselves three key questions:
 
* Can I rewrite this action to make the characteristic that I’m highlighting stand out more?
* Are there other experiences and actions in my history that better reflect this characteristic?
* When analyzing my experiences and actions, are there other characteristics that could be highlighted that I have overlooked?

We ask ourselves the first question constantly while writing. We ask the other two questions in the planning phase before writing — but also when we get stuck or step back to evaluate and reflect on our work. The questions represent different gears in our engine. Shifting between those gears prompts us to change our perspective and engage in both convergent and divergent thinking as necessary.

We’re writing explicitly to communicate a message to an audience, and résumés are short enough that we can revise them rapidly over many drafts. For an assignment less personal, creating ads has similar mechanics.  I allow students to stop revising their résumés once they are satisfied because my goal is for them to develop their own standards, not try to guess mine.

It takes time for some students to realize that any action, no matter how minor, can go into their résumé as long as it highlights a selected characteristic.

Taking advantage of our brand new résumé writing skills, we create character studies for characters we create ourselves and characters we find in works of fiction.

We explicitly leverage our résumé writing skills and analytical engine to develop strong characters in fiction and to study people in general for the rest of the year. Along the way, we rebuild our engine by adding a fourth gear or feedback loop: What does a person’s actions tell us about that person?

Shifting their engines through the first three gears and not finding the answers they were expecting slammed students into the fourth gear, triggering cognitive dissonance: What do my actions tell me about me?

We use these questions to rebuild our engines, adding a fifth gear; and we use that engine to set new personal goals by writing the résumé we would like to write in two years — at the end of our freshman year in high school — if we were the person we wanted to be.

In Why We Should Learn Vertically, I lay out the case that, given the necessary materials and culture, we are all capable of developing active sense-making mindsets that enable us to act coherently and strategically. The key is:

* Building an engine (grounding mental models)
* Rebuilding the engine with new gears (scaling mental models)
* Using the engine to take us places (leveraging mental models)
* Driving into the unknown (seeking out cognitive dissonance)

Here is the engine we built in The Résumé Project:

* Can I rewrite this action to make the characteristic that I’m highlighting stand out more?
* Are there other experiences and actions in my history that better reflect this characteristic?
* When analyzing my experiences and actions, are there other characteristics that could be highlighted that I have overlooked?
* What do my actions tell me about me?
* Is the truth of me always reflected in my actions? Can we change the truth of ourselves by changing our actions?
