An article of [David Ng's](https://medium.com/@dng_16133) showed up in my feed last week.  As it was about to Seymour Papert ([Where Seymour Papert Got It Wrong](https://medium.com/vertical-learning/where-seymour-papert-got-it-wrong-6203f94149d1)), I gave it a read. 

I must confess to being a follower of things MIT since I discovered [SCRATCH](https://scratch.mit.edu/) in my first year teaching Information and Computer Technologies.  People and happenings at [MIT's MediaLab](https://medium.com/@medialab) have profoundly shaped how I teach - but that is a story for another time.

Ng's thesis is that many have been missed the core message of Papert's _Mindstorms_, stating outright:

> There is a lot to learn from Papert and his amazing body of work—but not if we continue misunderstanding him.



I was really struck his interperetation of Papert's _Mindstorms_, specifically how he characterizes the first of what he presents as _"two central theses"_:

> The first thesis is there’s no such thing as easy or hard subjects, only domains with abundant materials or sparse materials.

Ng then how Papert compares the learning of 

that a child learns to speak French in France due to the abundant materials for learning - namely complete immersion in the language, whereas learning a different domain of knowledge, like Math, does not occur due to the puacity of Math "materials" surrounding us; and that to be as equally conversant in Math would require living in a

Papert presents argument that we live in a Mathophobic culture, an "Anti-Mathland" if you will, where not only is there sparse materials for constructing an meaningful understanding of Math, but that any  



To get around this seemingly insurmountable obstacle, Papert advances a second thesis. Because a computer can be programmed to take on different functions, maybe children can use computers to build their own materials, bypassing adults and inoculating themselves from the mathophobic culture. 

It’s clear this second thesis is a Hail Mary pass. Papert doesn’t propose that children in France build their own materials for learning French. It’s access to raw materials that matters, not who provides them. If children have access to the materials they need to construct their own understanding, they will. He only proposes children use computers to build their own Mathland materials because he knows the adults can’t.

 


Ng continues to present Papert's view 

Nicely sums up thinking that underpins my teaching, specifically in STEM program.

His thesis that we can learn anything if we have access to the materials we need to construct our own understanding is both profound and transformative.  

To put it bluntly, people who grow up in a mathophobic culture are generally incapable of building Mathland materials.



They are no more capable of building Mathland materials than the adults around them.

Can children use computers to inoculate themselves from the surrounding culture and build their own materials? Not simply use Logo, but build new materials better than Logo? The results seem to indicate they can’t. 

He only proposes children use computers to build their own Mathland materials because he knows the adults can’t.

### Thesis - imp

## Middle - 1 - what did

Here is the engine we built in The Résumé Project:
* Can I rewrite this action to make the characteristic that I’m highlighting stand out more?
* Are there other experiences and actions in my history that better reflect this characteristic?
* When analyzing my experiences and actions, are there other characteristics that could be highlighted that I have overlooked?
* What do my actions tell me about me?
* Is the truth of me always reflected in my actions? Can we change the truth of ourselves by changing our actions?

The use of engine and gears being a nod to Seymour Papert, [The Gears of My Childhood](http://www.papert.org/articles/GearsOfMyChildhood.html)

## Middle - 2 - connect real to fiction/other for Students Autism Spectrum

connection between resume writing and Character Studies in fiction
Taking advantage of our brand new résumé writing skills, we create character studies for characters we create ourselves and characters we find in works of fiction.
We explicitly leverage our résumé writing skills and analytical engine to develop strong characters in fiction and to study people in general for the rest of the year. 

## Middle - 3 - springboard

This was an opportunity to be thoughtful and intentional,
a more powerful experience.
The discussion was real and personal, not abstract
By starting from a shared understanding, we were able to revise and extend that shared understanding together.
And in writing future résumés, we didn’t start from a place of wish-fulfillment. We asked hard questions: 

The key is:
* Building an engine (grounding mental models)
* Rebuilding the engine with new gears (scaling mental models)
* Using the engine to take us places (leveraging mental models)
* Driving into the unknown (seeking out cognitive dissonance)
