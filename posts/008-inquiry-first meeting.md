Hello All,
I've set up a doodle poll for us to select a month/day in which to meet, if that makes sense and we can go from there:
http://doodle.com/poll/643kesbne59sh2wt

•	Choose our first meeting day; Poll to follow.
•	Clarify HOW to get Inquiry EOC release time;  Documentation to follow.

We have release time for 2 whole days each.  The structure I suggest is:

Meeting | Length | Purpose
---- | ---- | ----
1 | Half Day | Meet; Show resources; go off and think
2 | All Day | first half - talk choices, share; 
  |   |  second half; in your partner groups - work where best fits
3 | Half Day | share what worked, didn't, etc


I have a suggested agenda for our Thursday meeting:

A)  Project sharing -- I'd be happy to bring some examples/paperwork for some of the projects we've been up to if that would be useful.  I'd love to see what you guys are up to as well.

B)  Creation of a teacher group forum --  I'd like to suggest using Google Classroom or something like it to have a common place to put resources (like the project sharing) for our STEM schools.

C)  Student platforms for skill development --  I've got pretty diverse groups and I'm sure you do too.  The students don't seem to have any centralized place to share ideas/form a STEM expert community.  Google Classroom doesn't seem to be flexible enough for that.  Perhaps we could find a solution so that students can help each other with homework etc. 

Anyway.  Any suggestions you have would be great.  I think we're still planning to meet at the Hastings Community Centre..is that true, John?  If so, do you know the room number?  As a back-up, we can still do Templeton.


 
Hey guys.  Guess what?  

I've set up a doodle poll for us to select a month/day in which to meet, if that makes sense and we can go from there:

They are all day 1, so tell me if that's a problem.  At the moment, I am pretty motivated to meet somewhere other than one of the schools.  Sometimes its good to get away from "school brain".  If we are interested in meeting off campus, I can see about finding some central location for us to meet.

Have a good weekend!

Mike

Teachers should refer any questions to their principals and vice-principals or Pro D Chairperson.
 
1.       The following dates are not available for booking collaborative inquiry release time, due to previously scheduled events requiring large numbers of TTOCs.

2.       Guidelines for Booking TTOCs
a.    Book TTOCs 5 days in advance of the date required. This will allow SFE staff to notify schools if there are any difficulties in providing release time coverage.
b.    Book on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday (as there are significantly more absences on Mondays and Fridays, reducing the number of available TTOCs)
c.     Best months for booking release time (due to lower level of absences) include:  September, October, January, April, May 
d.    Last day for booking TTOCs – Friday, May 27th.

Support for Inquiry 
1.       Facilitators – if any of your groups have requested facilitators, we will share that info with the district team, and you will be contacted directly.
2.       Professional Resource Funding support – each school applying will receive between $200-400 per site, depending on size, for resources in support of the inquiry. 
 
Thank you
