Hello All,
I've set up a doodle poll for us to select a month/day in which to meet, if that makes sense and we can go from there:
http://doodle.com/poll/643kesbne59sh2wt

•	Choose our first meeting day; Poll to follow.
•	Clarify HOW to get Inquiry EOC release time;  Documentation to follow.

We have release time for 2 whole days each.  The structure I suggest is:

Meeting | Length | Purpose
---- | ---- | ----
1 | Half Day | Meet; Show resources; go off and think
2 | All Day | first half - talk choices, share; 
  |   |  second half; in your partner groups - work where best fits
3 | Half Day | share what worked, didn't, etc

# Info concerning booking of TTOCs
 
Booking TTOCs is the school’s responsibility. Please read the following information and assist the SFE staff in following these procedures. 
Teachers should refer any questions to their principals and vice-principals or Pro D Chairperson.
 
## Guidelines for Booking TTOCs

* Book TTOCs 5 days in advance of the date required. This will allow SFE staff to notify schools if there are any difficulties in providing release time coverage.
* Book on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday (as there are significantly more absences on Mondays and Fridays, reducing the number of available TTOCs)
* For SFE - please use the following information and note that only numbers should be entered in the Budget Code field; no spaces, or special characters.
  * Reason – 308
  * Budget Code - 111612112schoolsite#1724   (enter school site number – no # sign)
 




# Professional Resource Funding support – each school applying will receive between $200-400 per site, depending on size, for resources in support of the inquiry.
