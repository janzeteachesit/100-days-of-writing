In the Epidemics curriculum, students use StarLogo TNG simulations to study and break down the complex nature of epidemics, to understand the role of humans in dealing with epidemics, and to analyze the costs and benefits of preventions and interventions. In addition to studying these scientific simulations, students will also learn to modify the simulations through simple TNG programming to perform their own experiments about epidemics. While the curriculum allows students to explore epidemics in the classroom, the activities connect the knowledge and skills students are gaining to the real world.

This curriculum of 5 lessons, each about 45 minutes long, was designed for middle school science teachers. However, these activities also provide a general introduction StarLogo TNG modeling and programming and highlight the value of simulation in modern science.

Problem Statement:

We are actively preparing for missions to Mars but the generation most likely to get us there are in our classrooms now. Our gap is between those currently working on the missions and those who will physically colonize and live there.
