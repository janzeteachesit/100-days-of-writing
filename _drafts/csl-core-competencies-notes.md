- Point/Snapshot/Event

> Quality assessment:
> - focuses on all three components of the curriculum model – __knowing, doing, understanding__
> - provides ongoing descriptive feedback to students
> - provides __varied and multiple opportunities__ for learners to demonstrate their learning
> - involves student in their learning
> - promotes development of __student self-assessment and goal setting__ for next steps in learning
> - allows for __a collection of student work to be gathered over time__ to provide a full profile of the learner and learning
>
> This process assists students in moving forward __toward their learning targets and goals__. Students are encouraged to __reflect and self-assess__ to build important meta-cognitive skills. Personalization lends itself to assessment as learning, where __students participate in the setting of criteria and the design of inquiries, and self- and peer-assessment__.

## Retrospective
**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: 
1.  What is your inquiry question?
    - create meaningful, robust, criteria/rubrics for formatively communicating and assessing student learning
    - encouraging our students to be reflective with respect to their learning (both successes and areas of growth). 
    - Students would be assessing themselves on a continuum (i.e. meeting expectations, exceeding expectations...etc)
2.  Please send us 2 -5 sentences about where you are at?
