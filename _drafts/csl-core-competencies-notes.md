##### Thesis/Essential question:  

> What does Quality Self-Assessment (of the Core competencies) look like?

-  Core competencies are sets of intellectual, personal, and social and emotional proficiencies that all students need to develop in order to engage in deep learning and life-long learning.
-  Communication -The communication competency encompasses the set of abilities that students use to impart and exchange information, experiences and ideas, to explore the world around them, and to understand and effectively engage in the use of digital media.
-  Thinking - The thinking competency encompasses the knowledge, skills and processes we associate with intellectual development. It is through their competency as thinkers that students take subject-specific concepts and content and transform them into a new understanding. Thinking competence includes specific thinking skills as well as habits of mind, and metacognitive awareness.
-  Personal and Social - Personal and social competency is the set of abilities that relate to students' identity in the world, both as individuals and as members of their community and society. Personal and social competency encompasses the abilities students need to thrive as individuals, to understand and care about themselves and others, and to find and achieve their purposes in the world.

> Quality assessment:
> - focuses on all three components of the curriculum model – __knowing, doing, understanding__
> - provides ongoing descriptive feedback to students
> - provides __varied and multiple opportunities__ for learners to demonstrate their learning
> - involves student in their learning
> - promotes development of __student self-assessment and goal setting__ for next steps in learning
> - allows for __a collection of student work to be gathered over time__ to provide a full profile of the learner and learning
>
> This process assists students in moving forward __toward their learning targets and goals__. Students are encouraged to __reflect and self-assess__ to build important meta-cognitive skills. Personalization lends itself to assessment as learning, where __students participate in the setting of criteria and the design of inquiries, and self- and peer-assessment__.

Students to set learning goals for third term for Math and Science:

- What the student _knows_ (Content)
- What the student can _do_ (Curricular Competencies)
- What the student _understands_ (Big Ideas)

>  There is no expectation for teachers to report on Core 
Competencies because teachers are in fact assessing core competencies as 
they report on the curricular competencies in each curricular area.  However, it is 
important that students be able to identify their strengths and areas for 
improvement through self-reflection and self-assessment (student voice).  In 
taking ownership of their learning, students should be able to describe how they 
are developing their Core Competencies, with the help of their teacher where 
necessary.  (sample templates and tools will be provided).

## Retrospective
**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**: 
1.  What is your inquiry question?
    - create meaningful, robust, criteria/rubrics for formatively communicating and assessing student learning
    - encouraging our students to be reflective with respect to their learning (both successes and areas of growth). 
    - Students would be assessing themselves on a continuum (i.e. meeting expectations, exceeding expectations...etc)
2.  Please send us 2 -5 sentences about where you are at?
