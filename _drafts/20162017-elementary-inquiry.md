> How does a project-based STEM learning environment increase authentic student engagement in Elementary Math, Science and the new Design and Coding curriculum?

As you know, the BC Government mandates that students must “experience a minimum of three modules of [Applied Design, Skills, and Technologies](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/applied-design-skills-and-technologies/introduction) ADST in each of Grades 6 and 7”.

I am offering to share 3 teachable modules addressing the new ADST curriculum, specifically:
- [Computational Thinking](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/8)
  - software programs as specific and sequential instructions with algorithms that can be reliably repeated by others
  - debugging algorithms and programs by breaking problems down into a series of sub-problems
  - binary number system (1s and 0s) to represent data
  - programming languages, including visual programming in relation to text-based programming and programming modular components
- [Computers and Communications Devices](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/8)
  - design and function of digital infrastructures, from personal communication systems to wide area networks and the Internet of Things
  - social, cultural, and economic impact of mobile devices
  - systems for information transfer and communication, including videos, blogs, podcasts, and social media
  - keyboarding techniques
- [Media Arts](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/8)  
  - digital and non-digital media technologies, their distinguishing characteristics, and their uses, including layout and design, graphics and images, and video production techniques for using images, sounds, and text to represent characterizations and points of view of people, including themselves, as well as settings and ideas
  - story principles and genre conventions
  - media technologies and techniques to shape space, time, movement, and lighting within images, sounds, and text for specific purposes
  - processes for manipulating and testing digital media data
  - issues in ethical media practices, including cultural appropriation, moral copyright, reproduction, and privacy
  - elements of media arts used to communicate meaning
  - influences of digital media, including on communication and self-expression

Each teacher would be able to test a complete set of lesson plans and student handouts for each module, for both "Digital" (device-based) and “Unplugged” (paper-based) activities.
