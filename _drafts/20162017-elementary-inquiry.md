> Inquiry Question: How does a project-based STEM learning environment increase authentic student engagement in Elementary Math, Science and the new Design and Coding curriculum?

As you know, the BC Government mandates that students must “experience a minimum of three modules of [Applied Design, Skills, and Technologies](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/applied-design-skills-and-technologies/introduction) ADST in each of Grades 6 and 7”.

Each teacher would be able to test a complete set of lesson plans and student handouts for each Project-based module, for both "Digital" (device-based) and “Unplugged” (paper-based) activities.

I am offering to share 3 teachable modules addressing the new ADST curriculum, specifically:

# [Computational Thinking (CT)](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/7)
  - simple algorithms that reflect computational thinking;  for sorting, searching, sequence, selection, and repetition; specific statements to complete a simple task; cryptography and code breaking (e.g., cyphers) 
  - visual representations of problems and data;  graphs, charts, network diagrams, info graphics, flow charts, lists, tables, or arrays 
  - evolution of programming languages; historical perspectives, evolution (e.g., Ada Lovelace, punch cards, Hollerith, Grace Hopper, Alan Turing, Enigma, cyphers) 
  - visual programming;  for example, Kodu, Scratch

- [Betty's Brain](http://www.teachableagents.org/research/bettysbrain.php)

## CT-Unplugged
### [CS Unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/activities/)
 - [Harold the Robot](http://csunplugged.org/harold-the-robot-2/) - In this activity children simply give directions to a “robot” (either an adult or another child) and find out which instructions the robot is able to follow, and how their instructions are taken literally.
 - [Phylogenetics](http://csunplugged.org/phylogenetics/) - Bioinformatics is a discipline that combines computer science and biology. Bioinformatics uses the algorithms and technology of computer science, mathematics, and statistics to solve problems for biology. For example, it has allowed biologists to reconstruct phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees using computer science techniques such as string matching, edit distance, and matrices.  This activity lets students participate in the process of reconstructing a phylogenetic tree and introduces them to several core bioinformatics concepts. It’s a good exercise for classes in biology (evolution), bioinformatics (phylogenetics), or mathematics (matrices). It’s suitable for ages ten and up, and doesn’t require too much prior knowledge: just following instructions, writing, and basic math.
