> How does a project-based STEM learning environment increase authentic student engagement in Elementary Math, Science and the new Design and Coding curriculum?

As you know, the BC Government mandates that students must “experience a minimum of three modules of [Applied Design, Skills, and Technologies](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/applied-design-skills-and-technologies/introduction) ADST in each of Grades 6 and 7”.

I am offering to share 3 teachable modules addressing the new ADST curriculum, specifically:
- [Computational Thinking](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/7)
  - simple algorithms that reflect computational thinking
  - visual representations of problems and data
  - evolution of programming languages
  - visual programming
- [Computers and Communications Devices](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/7)
  - computer system architecture, including hardware and software, network infrastructure (local), intranet/Internet, and personal communication devices
  - strategies for identifying and troubleshooting simple hardware and software problems
  - function of input and output devices, including 3D printing and adaptive technologies for those with special needs
  - ergonomics in use of computers and computing devices
  - effective and efficient keyboarding techniques

- [Media Arts](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/adst/7)  
  - digital and non-digital media, and their distinguishing characteristics and uses
  - techniques for using images, sounds, and text to communicate information, settings, ideas, and story structure
  - media technologies and techniques to capture, edit, and manipulate images, sounds, and text for specific purposes
  - influences of digital media for the purpose of communication and self-expression


Each teacher would be able to test a complete set of lesson plans and student handouts for each module, for both "Digital" (device-based) and “Unplugged” (paper-based) activities.
