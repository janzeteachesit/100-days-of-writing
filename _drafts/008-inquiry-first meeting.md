Hello All,

Now that the year is fully in swing, it is time to get our Inquiry started. 

## Inquiry Structure

We have release time for 2 whole days each.  Tentative structure:

Meeting | Length | Purpose
---- | ---- | ----
1 | Half Day, Feb. | Intros; Purpose; Goals; Resources; Next Steps
2 | All Day, Mar. | First half - Who is choosing to try out what, Idea Share 
  |   |  Second half; In your partners/groups, spend afternoon preparing
3 | Half Day, May | Share What worked, What Would Change, What Would Add

I am open to any changes, though.

* Professional Resource Funding support â€“ each school applying will receive between $200-400 per site, depending on size, for resources in support of the inquiry.
