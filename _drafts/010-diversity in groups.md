This is how diversity works: by promoting hard work and creativity; by encouraging the consideration of alternatives even before any interpersonal interaction takes place. The pain associated with diversity can be thought of as the pain of exercise. You have to push yourself to grow your muscles. The pain, as the old saw goes, produces the gain. In just the same way, we need diversity—in teams, organizations and society as a whole—if we are to change, grow and innovate.

##[Reaping The Benefits Of Diversity For Modern Business Innovation](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ekaterinawalter/2014/01/14/reaping-the-benefits-of-diversity-for-modern-business-innovation/#2ca202a36476)

Stephen Covey once said: “Strength lies in differences, not in similarities.”

Diversity is critical for organization’s ability to innovate and adapt in a fast-changing environment. Some of the most successful entrepreneurs and most admired leaders will tell you the same thing. Diversity is essential to growth and prosperity of any company: diversity of perspectives, experiences, cultures, genders, and age. Why? Because diversity breeds innovation. And innovation breeds business success. Don’t believe me? Take a look:

* [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/forbesinsights/innovation_diversity/index.html) study has identified workforce diversity and inclusion as a key driver of internal innovation and business growth.
* Lu Hong and Scott Page [showed](http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~spage/pnas.pdf) that groups of diverse problem solvers can outperform groups of high-ability problem solvers.
* [According to McKinsey](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/is_there_a_payoff_from_top-team_diversity), companies with diverse executive boards enjoy significantly higher earnings and returns on equity.
* [According to Harvard Business School](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6645.html), multicultural networks promote creativity.

Successful companies are not the ones that build a business, then look at diversity as a nice-to-have attribute. Truly successful and innovative companies are those that build diverse teams when they are just starting out in their own apartment or their folks’ garage. Diversity is a mentality, not just strategic imperative.
