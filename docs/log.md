### January 23, 2017 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started 4 different pieces of writing - a lot of it work-related, but still all with "stretch".  Finished [My (Current) Publishing Workflow - Medium](https://medium.com/@janzeteachesit/my-current-publishing-workflow-a043e9cd3272).  See yesterday.

**Thoughts**: 
All are initial - read "still in posts".  Have to pick which one first.
