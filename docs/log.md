**Today's Progress**: Why I am using Google Classroom

**Thoughts**: related to getting student info/feedback; engaging/gaining user experience - interaction?; 

* EMPATHIZE: Work to fully understand the experience of the user for whom you are designing.  Do this through observation, interaction, and immersing yourself in their experiences. [1] 
* "engaging and empathizing with people to understand their experiences and motivations... Depending on time constraints, a substantial amount of information is gathered ... to develop the best possible understanding of the users, their needs, and the problems that underlie the development of that particular product." [3]  
* 'The goal is to gather enough observations that you can truly begin to empathize with your users and their perspectives.' [4]  
* "... finding out what they value, what they want and how they look at the world." [5]
